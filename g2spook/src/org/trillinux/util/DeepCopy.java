 * Utility for making deep copies (vs. clone()'s shallow copies) of objects.
 * Objects are first serialized and then deserialized. Error checking is fairly
 * minimal in this implementation. If an object is encountered that cannot be
 * serialized (or that references an object that cannot be serialized) an error
 * is printed to System.err and null is returned. Depending on your specific
 * application, it might make more sense to have copy(...) re-throw the
